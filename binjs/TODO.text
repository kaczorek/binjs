addd asserts to scripts in src/test

### Build 

Options on where to deploy the code /lib  or /usr/lib

Replace all build.sh with Make files
curl github.com/teknopaul/binjs/install.sh | bash style script
Find way to apply patches to bash
Use correct Ubuntu / Fedora versions of bash

### Libs & Modules

Probably best to leave Libs as they are and add Module support
var assert = require("assert"); needed since it seems node and CommonJS does this
Modules using require() should run it its own scope

Check out how to use npm without messing up
