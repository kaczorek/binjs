# /bin/js README

Welcome to /bin/js scripting the way you always wanted it. A fine mashup of bash command line and JavaScript syntax for the code.

/bin/js enables you to write JavaScript with embedded bash like this...

    #!/bin/js
    #
    # My First Script
    #
    var i;
    for (i = 0 ; i <  10; i++ ) {

        echo Printed with Bash 4.2

        $.println("Printed with Google v8", true);

    }

Once you have compiled and installed /bin/js you can run the above example.bjs.
